              <p>Yes, we have! We both got our Ph.D. in Physics at the University of Nottingham (UK) in 2012.

              <p>This depends very much on the state of your manuscript and your target journal. If you feel confident that your writing is already of a high standard, and what you need is only a thorough check of the grammar/vocabulary/sentence structure, then our Basic editing service is for you. If, however, you would like us to provide you with a more in-depth editing service, involving also content improvement, then choose our Premium editing service. Finally, if you know that your document would benefit from an extensive language and content improvement, including suggestions regarding the figures, then our Advanced editing service is for you. We recommend this service also if you wish to submit your manuscript to high-impact journals.</p>

              <p>Yes, absolutely! Figures are a key part in any manuscript. Due to lack of time, too often readers skim over the text and focus on the figures. That's why figures are so important and the message of your work should be clearly presented in the figures. If you choose our Advanced editing service, we will provide plenty of suggestions on how you can improve your figures.</p>
